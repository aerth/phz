## built-in template functions:

```
var builtins = FuncMap{
    "and":      and,
    "call":     call,
    "html":     HTMLEscaper,
    "index":    index,
    "js":       JSEscaper,
    "len":      length,
    "not":      not,
    "or":       or,
    "print":    fmt.Sprint,
    "printf":   fmt.Sprintf,
    "println":  fmt.Sprintln,
    "urlquery": URLQueryEscaper,
}

```
and
	Returns the boolean AND of its arguments by returning the
	first empty argument or the last argument, that is,
	"and x y" behaves as "if x then y else x". All the
	arguments are evaluated.
call
	Returns the result of calling the first argument, which
	must be a function, with the remaining arguments as parameters.
	Thus "call .X.Y 1 2" is, in Go notation, dot.X.Y(1, 2) where
	Y is a func-valued field, map entry, or the like.
	The first argument must be the result of an evaluation
	that yields a value of function type (as distinct from
	a predefined function such as print). The function must
	return either one or two result values, the second of which
	is of type error. If the arguments don't match the function
	or the returned error value is non-nil, execution stops.
html
	Returns the escaped HTML equivalent of the textual
	representation of its arguments. This function is unavailable
	in html/template, with a few exceptions.
index
	Returns the result of indexing its first argument by the
	following arguments. Thus "index x 1 2 3" is, in Go syntax,
	x[1][2][3]. Each indexed item must be a map, slice, or array.
js
	Returns the escaped JavaScript equivalent of the textual
	representation of its arguments.
len
	Returns the integer length of its argument.
not
	Returns the boolean negation of its single argument.
or
	Returns the boolean OR of its arguments by returning the
	first non-empty argument or the last argument, that is,
	"or x y" behaves as "if x then x else y". All the
	arguments are evaluated.
print
	An alias for fmt.Sprint
printf
	An alias for fmt.Sprintf
println
	An alias for fmt.Sprintln
urlquery
	Returns the escaped value of the textual representation of
	its arguments in a form suitable for embedding in a URL query.
	This function is unavailable in html/template, with a few
	exceptions.
